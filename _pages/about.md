## Srikrishna Iyer

I am a Senior Research Engineer at [ST Engineering](https://www.stengg.com/) in the Data analytics strategic technology centre [DA STC](https://www.stengg.com/en/innovation/solving-the-world-s-problems-with-data-science/) where my general area of research is machine learning. I have a Masters degree from Nanyang Technological University, Singapore and I completed my undergrad in Vellore Institute of Technology, India. 

## Research Interests

* Deep learning
* Ensemble learning
* Explainable AI
* Time series modelling : Predictive maintenance, anomaly detection
* Multimodal machine learning learning : NLP, Computer vision

My research goal is to leverage data-driven AI to extract key insights from structured and unstructured data that relates to existing knowledge of the world (eg. Images, language, sensors), thereby investigating and developing probabilistic models that are robust, generalized, interpretable, and optimized to help solve real-world problems more efficiently. More specifically, integrating multiple modalities including language, images and structured information using mutlimodal machine learning, thus tackle five key challenges associated to it:
(1) Representation learning 
(2) Translaiton and mapping 
(3) modality alignment 
(4) multimodal fusion 
(5) co-learning
