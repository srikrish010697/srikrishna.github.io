## 2022
__Oct__
 - Joined ST Engineering as a senior research engineer

__July__
 - Promoted to Data Analyst I at ASMPT. 

__June__
 - Presented work on the _NN_XGB_Ensemble_ model for wire bond quality prediction in ASM

__May__
 - Started work on predictive maintenance for wire bond machines in ASM. This project will allow engineers to minimize replacement and maintenance costs during production.

__April__
 - Our work, [_mm-Wave radar based vital signs monitoring and Arrhythmia detection using machine learning_](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/9/3106), is now available online. 


## 2021
__December__
 - Presented quality prediction model analysis as a proof of concept to UTL Thailand for quality forecasting.

__June__
 - Presented a CI/CD pipeline implemntation for automatic model delivery during production using AWS Codepipeline and AWS Sagemaker services. It was the compnay's 1st step towards complete automation of AI model management. 


## 2020
__September__
 - Started working as Data Analyst II at ASM Pacific Technology, Singapore.
 - Our work, [_Structural health monitoring of railway tracks using IoT-based multi-robot system_](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00521-020-05366-9), is now available online.
 - Graduated with Masters degree (Msc.) from Nanyang Technological University, Singapore specializing in Computer control and automation.
 - Submission of patent on _Non-Invasive Blood Pressure Monitoring Using Dual mm-Wave FMCW Radars With Machine Learning_. Patent application No. 10202009121P

__May__
 - Joined NCS pvt. Ltd. as a research intern 
 - Worked with researchers at NCS on building a people counting and tracking system using mmWave radars. The radar processing pipeline consists of techniques like CFAR(Constant false alarm rate) and beamforming to perform multi-object detection and Extended Kalman filter (EKF) for object tracking.
 - Created a standard operating procedure for sensor calibration tp prevent ghost detections (False detections).
 - Prepared the output data structure consisting of target_ID, velocity_X&Y ,position_X&Y, acceleration X&Y, error covariance matrix, Gating function gain for post processing.
 - Submitted Masters thesis on _mm-Wave radar based vital signs monitoring and Arrhythmia detection using machine learning_
